# Neural-Style-Transfer
Neural Style Transfer is a technique for blending a content picture with a style image such that the output image appears like the content image but is painted in the style of the style image. Using the content and style image, I developed an artistic style image. Extract style and content features from images, using a pre-trained network. Implemented style transfer according to the paper, Image Style Transfer Using Convolutional Neural Networks by Gatys et. al.Define appropriate losses for iteratively creating a target, style-transferred image of your own design!
